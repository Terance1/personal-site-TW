                 <P>A military man, Slade Wilson was recruited into the special ops unit Team 7, where he participated in highly dangerous classified missions. Willing to do whatever he could to better himself, Slade underwent an experimental procedure that granted him enhanced speed, strength and intelligence, effectively making him the world's greatest soldier </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>He killed his own son </li>
                    <li>his wife shot him in the eye</li>
                    <li>he (nearly) defeated the whole justice league</li>
                    <li>he (nearly) killed batman</li>
                    <li>He killed the Teen Titans</li>
                </ol>
                    <p>A man is only as good as his word. But in the underground world of assassins, mercenaries, and guns for hire, words mean little. What matters is action and follow through completing the mission. That’s what makes you good. Never failing even when it comes to taking down the World’s Greatest Super Heroes, some of the most powerful beings in the world that’s what makes you the best. That’s what makes you Deathstroke.</p>
